Build and Deploy a Machine Learning Model using Docker. 

1. main.py: Train and save a RandomForestClassifier on the titanic.csv file to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic ship would have survived. Features considered for the Binary Classification included: sex, passenger class and fare.
2. load_model.py: Enter the sex, passenger class and fare of a new passenger and load the saved model to predict whether he/she will survive or not.
3. Dockerfile: Define the environment variables, specify the working directory, copy the necessary files and write the python command for building an image that runs the load_model.py file.
4. Build the image with docker build -t titanic_model:1.0 . from the titanic_prediction directory
5. Run the container with docker run -it titanic_model:1.0 from the titanic_prediction directory
